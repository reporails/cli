# Instruction File Style

When writing or editing CLAUDE.md or .claude/rules/*.md files:

- These files are for AI agent behavior, not user-facing documentation
- State facts, commands, rules only
- No meta-commentary ("this section explains...", "as mentioned above...")
- Every line MUST be actionable or informative
- Avoid redundant context that wastes tokens
