# Specification Files

Specs must accurately reflect the implementation.

- Update specs when changing code behavior
- Function signatures, return types, and interfaces must match code
- Remove features from specs when removing from code
- Add features to specs when adding to code
- No aspirational content - document what exists, not what might exist
